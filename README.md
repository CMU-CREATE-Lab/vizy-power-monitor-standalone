This is a fork of https://github.com/charmedlabs/vizy, only containing files needed to manage Vizy's power board and control its fan.  It's originally set up for breathecam, but could be generally useful if you're building your own software stack for vizy.

Fan speeds are a little more aggressive in hopes it might help warm the front glass during wintertime?  That might be a stretch.

Installation:

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/CMU-CREATE-Lab/vizy-power-monitor-standalone.git
    vizy-power-monitor-standalone/install.py
